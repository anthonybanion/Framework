Welcome to **LearnFW**, a personal repository for learning and practicing with various web frameworks. This repository contains mini-projects, CRUD applications, APIs, and full-stack experiments developed using frameworks like:

- **Django**
- **Laravel**
- **Symfony**
- **React**
- **Vue.js**
- **Node.js**
- **Next.js**
- **Express.js**
- and more...

Each project is designed to help improve understanding and hands-on skills with these frameworks. You will find small and medium-sized projects, including basic functionality like CRUD operations, authentication, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anthonybanion/LearnFW.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the desired folder**:
    ```bash
    cd LearnFW/Symfony    # Example: for Symfony projects
    ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies** (depending on the framework):
    - For **Symfony**, run:
      ```bash
      composer install
      ```

    - For **Node.js** or **React**, run:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

4. **Run the development server**:
    - For **Symfony**:
      ```bash
      symfony server:start
      ```
    - For **Node.js** (Express or Next.js):
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

5. **Explore the projects** and learn from each framework. Each folder contains its own README.md with setup instructions specific to that framework.
