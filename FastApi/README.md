# ⚡ FastAPI — Mastering High-Performance Python APIs

Welcome to the `FastAPI/` directory of the **LearnFw** repository.  
This section is dedicated to learning and mastering **FastAPI**, a modern, high-performance Python framework for building APIs with automatic docs, type hints, and async support — powered by Starlette and Pydantic.

Whether you're building microservices, backend systems, or ML-serving APIs, FastAPI offers unmatched developer experience and performance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the basics of FastAPI and its async nature.
- Create RESTful APIs using automatic validation and documentation.
- Learn how to handle routes, parameters, JSON bodies, and dependencies.
- Integrate with databases using SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM.
- Implement authentication, error handling, background tasks, and async IO.
- Explore FastAPI’s dependency injection system and automatic OpenAPI docs.
- Deploy APIs using Docker, Uvicorn, and cloud platforms.

## 📚 Learning Path

This roadmap helps you build from scratch and deploy performant FastAPI applications step-by-step.

---

### 🧭 Stage 1 — Getting Started
- [ ] **Intro to FastAPI**: Learn why FastAPI is different (type hints, auto-docs, async support).
- [ ] **Project Setup**: Install FastAPI and Uvicorn. Run your first endpoint.
- [ ] **Swagger & Redoc**: Use FastAPI’s automatic documentation at `/docs` and `/redoc`.
- [ ] **Folder: `getting_started/`**

---

### 🧱 Stage 2 — Routes, Requests & Responses
- [ ] **Routing**: Handle HTTP verbs, path parameters, query params.
- [ ] **Request Bodies**: Accept and validate input using Pydantic models.
- [ ] **Response Models**: Define output schemas, use status codes and JSON serialization.
- [ ] **Folder: `routing/`, `request_body/`, `response_models/`**

---

### 🧩 Stage 3 — Dependencies & Middleware
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Inject logic using `Depends` — DB sessions, auth, reusable logic.
- [ ] **Middleware**: Add global processing (e.g., CORS, logging).
- [ ] **Folder: `dependencies/`, `middleware/`**

---

### ⚙️ Stage 4 — Auth, Errors & Background Tasks
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Use `HTTPException`, exception handlers, and validation messages.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Add JWT-based security using `OAuth2PasswordBearer`, scopes, and roles.
- [ ] **Background Tasks**: Send emails, write logs, or queue jobs asynchronously.
- [ ] **Folder: `error_handling/`, `authentication/`, `background_tasks/`**

---

### 🗃️ Stage 5 — Database Integration
- [ ] **SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM**: Connect to SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.
- [ ] **Pydantic with DB Models**: Use schemas for separation of concerns.
- [ ] **Alembic (if using SQLAlchemy)**: Manage migrations.
- [ ] **Folder: `database/`**

---

### 🧪 Stage 6 — Testing
- [ ] **TestClient**: Simulate API calls with FastAPI’s testing tools.
- [ ] **Mocking & Fixtures**: Use Pytest and custom fixtures.
- [ ] **Folder: `testing/`**

---

### 🚀 Stage 7 — Deployment
- [ ] **Uvicorn/Gunicorn**: Serve your app in production mode.
- [ ] **Dockerize**: Build a production image with environment configs.
- [ ] **Deploy to Platforms**: Railway, Heroku, Fly.io, or AWS Lambda.
- [ ] **Folder: `deployment/`**

---

### 🧠 Stage 8 — Advanced Features
- [ ] **CORS & Headers**: Enable CORS and manage custom headers.
- [ ] **WebSockets**: Add real-time capabilities to your app.
- [ ] **GraphQL**: Use Strawberry or Ariadne for GraphQL APIs.
- [ ] **Async IO**: Write fully async services using asyncio best practices.
- [ ] **Folder: `advanced/`**

---

### 💼 Stage 9 — Projects & Practice
- [ ] **Small Projects**: Ping API, joke service, contact form.
- [ ] **Basic Projects**: CRUD + Auth + DB.
- [ ] **Advanced Projects**: Role-based systems, multi-tenant APIs, rate limiting.
- [ ] **Folder: `projects/`**

---

## 💡 Extras

- Use `.env` + `python-dotenv` or Pydantic settings for config.
- Use `logging` and structured logs with `loguru` or custom formatters.
- Add rate limiting with `slowapi` or `starlette-limiter`.
- Use `ruff` + `black` + `isort` for clean, auto-formatted code.
- Host docs at `/docs`, make them public or protected.

---

## 🤝 Community & Contribution

- [ ] **Resources**: Add links to FastAPI docs, RealPython, YouTube tutorials, and GitHub repos in `resources/`.
- [ ] **Contribute**: Share new features, issues, or pull requests in this section.
- [ ] **Stay Updated**: Follow [fastapi.tiangolo.com](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), GitHub, Twitter, and Discord.
- [ ] **Join the Community**: Engage on Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Discord (#fastapi).
