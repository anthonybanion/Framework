# 🖖 Vue.js — Mastering the Progressive JavaScript Framework

Welcome to the `Vue/` directory of the **LearnFw** repository.  
This section is focused on learning and mastering **Vue.js**, the progressive JavaScript framework that is easy to pick up and integrate, yet powerful enough for building sophisticated single-page applications (SPAs).

Vue's core simplicity, component system, and ecosystem (Vue Router, Pinia, Vuex, Vite) make it a solid choice for both beginners and professional frontend developers.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the core principles of Vue.js: reactivity, declarative templates, and the virtual DOM.
- Build reusable components and manage application state.
- Handle forms, inputs, events, and lifecycle hooks.
- Use Vue Router for navigation and structure SPAs.
- Explore state management with Pinia or Vuex.
- Build and deploy fast, modern Vue applications with Vite or Vue CLI.

## 📚 Learning Path

This roadmap helps you move from beginner to intermediate/advanced Vue development step-by-step.

---

### 🧭 Stage 1 — Getting Started
- [ ] **What is Vue.js**: Learn about its progressive nature and MVVM design.
- [ ] **Install Vue**: Use Vue CLI or Vite to scaffold a new project.
- [ ] **Vue File Structure**: Understand `.vue` files and the role of `<script>`, `<template>`, and `<style>`.
- [ ] **Folder: `getting_started/`**

---

### 🧱 Stage 2 — Components & Reactivity
- [ ] **Props & Slots**: Pass data and inject content into components.
- [ ] **Reactivity**: Use `ref()`, `reactive()`, and `computed()` values.
- [ ] **Lifecycle**: Handle side effects with lifecycle hooks.
- [ ] **Folder: `components/`, `reactivity/`, `lifecycle/`**

---

### 🔁 Stage 3 — Forms & Events
- [ ] **Form Handling**: Use `v-model` for two-way binding and form controls.
- [ ] **Validation**: Add manual or library-based validation (like VeeValidate).
- [ ] **Events**: Handle native/custom events and emit up to parent components.
- [ ] **Folder: `forms/`, `events/`**

---

### 🛣️ Stage 4 — Routing & Navigation
- [ ] **Vue Router**: Define routes and dynamic parameters.
- [ ] **Navigation Guards**: Protect routes with guards and meta fields.
- [ ] **Nested Routes & Layouts**: Use `<router-view>` and nested views.
- [ ] **Folder: `routing/`**

---

### 🧠 Stage 5 — State Management
- [ ] **Pinia**: Set up stores and actions using Pinia.
- [ ] **Vuex (Legacy)**: Explore Vuex for older apps or larger structures.
- [ ] **Folder: `state_management/`**

---

### 🎨 Stage 6 — Styling & Layouts
- [ ] **Scoped Styles**: Write CSS locally for components.
- [ ] **Global Styles**: Use TailwindCSS or utility-first frameworks.
- [ ] **Dynamic Styling**: Apply class/style bindings conditionally.
- [ ] **Folder: `styling/`**

---

### 🧪 Stage 7 — Testing
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Test components using Vitest or Jest.
- [ ] **E2E Testing**: Automate UI tests with Cypress or Playwright.
- [ ] **Folder: `testing/`**

---

### 🚀 Stage 8 — Deployment
- [ ] **Build the App**: Use `vite build` or `vue-cli-service build`.
- [ ] **Deploy**: Host on Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, or custom server.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, code splitting.
- [ ] **Folder: `deployment/`**

---

### 🧩 Stage 9 — Advanced Concepts
- [ ] **Composition API**: Build with `setup()`, composables, and reusability.
- [ ] **Provide/Inject**: Share dependencies down the component tree.
- [ ] **Dynamic Components**: Use `<component :is="">` and conditional rendering.
- [ ] **SSR & Nuxt**: Explore Nuxt.js for server-side rendering.
- [ ] **Folder: `composition_api/`, `advanced/`**

---

### 💼 Stage 10 — Projects & Practice
- [ ] **Small Projects**: UI cards, counters, image sliders.
- [ ] **Basic Projects**: Blog CRUD, login/register, multi-page form.
- [ ] **Advanced Projects**: Admin dashboards, real-time chat, API-driven apps.
- [ ] **Folder: `projects/`**

---

## 💡 Extras

- Prefer **Composition API** for modern apps (but understand Options API too).
- Use `script setup` and `<style scoped>` for concise components.
- Use `volar` for TypeScript support in VS Code.
- Use `vueuse` for great composition utilities.

---

## 🤝 Community & Contribution

- [ ] **Resources**: Add Vue docs, tutorials, and videos in `resources/` (optional).
- [ ] **Contribute**: Share components, projects, or learning notes.
- [ ] **Follow**: [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org), [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/), and GitHub.
- [ ] **Join the Community**: Vue Discord, Reddit, Twitter (#vuejs), and forums.

Happy building with Vue! 🖖⚡
