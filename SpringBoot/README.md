# 🌱 Spring Boot — Mastering the Modern Java Backend

Welcome to the `SpringBoot/` directory of the **LearnFw** repository.  
This section is dedicated to learning and mastering **Spring Boot**, the most popular framework for building production-ready Java applications with minimal configuration and maximum power.

Whether you're building REST APIs, enterprise systems, or microservices, this space provides a structured path to develop robust backend applications using Spring Boot and the broader Spring ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand Spring Boot fundamentals: auto-configuration, starters, and dependency injection.
- Learn to build RESTful APIs using Spring Web and controllers.
- Handle validation, error handling, authentication, and application configuration.
- Integrate with databases using Spring Data JPA and connect to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or H2.
- Explore advanced topics like security, testing, scheduling, and microservices.
- Deploy applications using Docker and platforms like Heroku or Railway.

## 📚 Learning Path

This roadmap helps you move from Spring Boot beginner to building advanced and enterprise-ready Java applications.


### 🧭 Stage 1 — Getting Started
- [ ] **What is Spring Boot**: Understand its role in the Spring ecosystem.
- [ ] **Spring Initializr**: Generate a starter project with the required dependencies.
- [ ] **Project Structure**: Learn about `@SpringBootApplication`, packages, and main class.
- [ ] **Folder: `getting_started/`**


### 🧱 Stage 2 — REST API Basics
- [ ] **Controllers**: Handle HTTP methods using `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.
- [ ] **Services**: Write clean business logic in the service layer.
- [ ] **Models & DTOs**: Define entities and transfer objects.
- [ ] **Validation**: Use `@Valid`, `@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc., for input validation.
- [ ] **Folder: `controllers/`, `services/`, `models/`, `validation/`**


### 🗃️ Stage 3 — Database Integration
- [ ] **Repositories**: Use Spring Data JPA for database access.
- [ ] **Database Connection**: Connect to H2, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
- [ ] **Migrations**: Use Flyway or Liquibase for schema versioning.
- [ ] **Folder: `repositories/`, `database/`**


### 🔐 Stage 4 — Error Handling & Security
- [ ] **Global Exception Handling**: Use `@ControllerAdvice` and custom exceptions.
- [ ] **Spring Security**: Add authentication and authorization with roles and JWT.
- [ ] **Secure Endpoints**: Protect routes with filters and annotations.
- [ ] **Folder: `error_handling/`, `security/`**


### 🧪 Stage 5 — Testing
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Test services, repositories, and controllers.
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test full request-response lifecycle.
- [ ] **Folder: `testing/`**


### ⏲️ Stage 6 — Advanced Features
- [ ] **Scheduling**: Use `@Scheduled` for cron jobs and background tasks.
- [ ] **Caching**: Use `@Cacheable` with Redis or Caffeine.
- [ ] **Event Listeners**: Use `@EventListener` for domain events.
- [ ] **API Versioning**: Use URI or header-based API versioning.
- [ ] **Folder: `scheduling/`, `advanced/`**


### 🚀 Stage 7 — Deployment
- [ ] **YAML Configuration**: Manage environments with `application.yml` and profiles.
- [ ] **Dockerize the App**: Build Docker images for production.
- [ ] **Deploy**: Push to Heroku, Railway, or other cloud services.
- [ ] **Folder: `deployment/`**


### 🧩 Stage 8 — Projects & Practice
- [ ] **Small Projects**: Hello World, greeting APIs, mock DBs.
- [ ] **Basic Projects**: CRUD APIs with full validation and error handling.
- [ ] **Advanced Projects**: Auth systems, scheduling, file uploads, API docs with Swagger.
- [ ] **Folder: `projects/`**

---

## 🤝 Community & Contribution

- [ ] **Resources**: Add books, tutorials, cheatsheets to `resources/` (optional folder).
- [ ] **Contribute**: Share your own projects or reusable components.
- [ ] **Stay Updated**: Follow [spring.io](https://spring.io), YouTube (Amigoscode, Java Brains), GitHub, and conferences.
- [ ] **Join the Community**: Interact via Stack Overflow, Reddit, Discord, or Spring’s Gitter channels.
