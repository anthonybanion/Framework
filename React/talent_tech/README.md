# 🚀 React with Talento Tech – Course Journey 2025

Welcome to this repository, where I document my complete journey through the **React JS** course by **Talento Tech (2025 Edition)**.  
The main goal is to **learn React by building a functional e-commerce app**, while logging every class, problem, solution, and concept learned.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Learn the fundamentals of **React JS**: JSX, components, state, props, and hooks.
- Implement routing using **React Router**.
- Use **Context API** to manage global state.
- Apply **basic user authentication**.
- Build a complete **CRUD system** for products.
- Style the app using **Bootstrap or styled-components**.
- Deploy the final app to a live environment.

## 🧱 Course Structure

Each class in the course is documented as an **issue** in this repository. Each issue contains:

- ✔️ Topics covered.
- 🧪 Practical exercises and code samples.
- 🐞 Issues and bugs encountered.
- 🛠 Solutions and fixes.
- 💡 Reflections and takeaways.
