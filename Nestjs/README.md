# 🧱 NestJS — Mastering the Scalable Node.js Framework

Welcome to the `NestJS/` directory of the **LearnFw** repository.  
This section is dedicated to learning and mastering **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and well-structured server-side applications using TypeScript.

NestJS combines the best of OOP, FP, and reactive programming with the power of Express (or optionally Fastify), and provides a full set of tools for building robust backends.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand NestJS core concepts: modules, controllers, providers, and services.
- Build RESTful APIs and optionally GraphQL endpoints with clean architecture.
- Manage dependency injection and modular architecture effectively.
- Handle requests, data validation, authentication, and error handling.
- Integrate with databases using TypeORM, Prisma, or Sequelize.
- Explore advanced features like interceptors, guards, filters, and middleware.
- Learn to write unit and e2e tests, and deploy apps using Docker or cloud services.

## 📚 Learning Path

This roadmap helps you go from beginner to advanced with NestJS, building real-world backends with confidence.


### 🧭 Stage 1 — Getting Started
- [ ] **What is NestJS**: Understand its purpose and how it's different from plain Express.
- [ ] **Installation**: Install Nest CLI and create your first project (`nest new`).
- [ ] **Project Structure**: Learn how modules, controllers, and services work together.
- [ ] **TypeScript First**: Understand how Nest leverages decorators, interfaces, and DI.
- [ ] **Folder: `getting_started/`**


### 🧱 Stage 2 — Core Architecture
- [ ] **Modules**: Organize your app into feature modules.
- [ ] **Controllers**: Handle routing and HTTP methods.
- [ ] **Services**: Write reusable business logic.
- [ ] **Providers & Injection**: Learn about custom and async providers.
- [ ] **DTO & Validation**: Use `class-validator` and `class-transformer` for validation.
- [ ] **Folder: `modules/`, `controllers/`, `services/`, `dto_validation/`, `providers/`**


### 🔐 Stage 3 — Middleware, Guards, Interceptors
- [ ] **Middleware**: Use request interceptors and logger middleware.
- [ ] **Guards**: Implement role-based access control.
- [ ] **Interceptors**: Modify responses and apply logic before/after handlers.
- [ ] **Exception Filters**: Centralize error handling.
- [ ] **Folder: `middleware/`, `guards/`, `interceptors/`, `filters/`**


### 🗃️ Stage 4 — Databases & Authentication
- [ ] **Database Setup**: Connect with TypeORM, Prisma, or Sequelize.
- [ ] **Repository Pattern**: Handle DB queries using Nest’s built-in or custom repos.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Use Passport.js and JWT strategies.
- [ ] **Authorization**: Protect routes and use guards effectively.
- [ ] **Folder: `database/`, `authentication/`**


### 🧪 Stage 5 — Testing
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Test services and controllers in isolation.
- [ ] **E2E Testing**: Test API behavior end-to-end with Supertest.
- [ ] **Folder: `testing/`**


### 🚀 Stage 6 — Deployment & Real-World Topics
- [ ] **Deployment**: Use Docker, PM2, or deploy to Heroku/Railway/Vercel.
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Use `ConfigModule` and `.env` for secure config.
- [ ] **Performance & Logging**: Add structured logging with Winston or Pino.
- [ ] **Folder: `deployment/`**


### 🧠 Stage 7 — Advanced Features
- [ ] **GraphQL Support**: Use `@nestjs/graphql` with Apollo Server.
- [ ] **WebSockets**: Implement real-time communication.
- [ ] **Microservices**: Build distributed systems with NestJS transport layers (Redis, Kafka).
- [ ] **Cron Jobs & Scheduling**: Use `@nestjs/schedule`.
- [ ] **Folder: `advanced/`**

## 💡 Extras

- Use `@nestjs/config` for environment config and modular loading.
- Stick to SOLID principles — Nest is built for clean architecture.
- Follow the [NestJS style guide](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/style-guide) for best practices.
- Keep your modules small, cohesive, and reusable.

---

## 🤝 Community & Contribution

- [ ] **Resources**: Add links to videos, docs, and external tutorials in `resources/` (optional folder).
- [ ] **Open Source**: Contribute to NestJS or build public modules/packages.
- [ ] **Stay Updated**: Follow [nestjs.com](https://nestjs.com), GitHub, YouTube, and Twitter.
- [ ] **Join the Community**: Get involved via Discord, Reddit, and Stack Overflow.
