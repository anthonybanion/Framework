# ⚛️ React — Mastering the Modern Frontend

Welcome to the `React/` directory of the **LearnFw** repository.  
This section is dedicated to learning and mastering **React**, one of the most powerful and widely used JavaScript libraries for building dynamic and modern user interfaces.

Whether you're just getting started or aiming to build full-scale applications, this space provides a progressive structure to guide your learning journey.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand React's core concepts: components, JSX, props, state, and hooks.
- Build modular, scalable, and maintainable user interfaces.
- Learn to manage routing, global state, side effects, and API integration.
- Combine React with modern tools such as Tailwind CSS, Redux, Axios, and React Router.
- Gain experience through hands-on projects of increasing complexity.

## 📅 File Organization Tips

Use ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for timestamps in comments and filenames when necessary.  
You can also include docstrings in the **Google Style** format for complex components and utilities.

## 🧠 Notes

- All code examples follow React 18+ conventions.
- Use functional components and hooks as the standard approach.
- Ensure to keep up with the latest React features and best practices.
- Feel free to add your own projects or resources to the respective folders.
