# 🚀 Symfony — Mastering the PHP Framework

Welcome to the **Symfony/** directory of the **LearnFw** repository.
This section is dedicated to learning and mastering Symfony, one of the most robust and flexible PHP frameworks for building high-performance, scalable web applications.

Whether you're just getting started with PHP frameworks or aiming to build enterprise-level applications, this space provides a structured approach to guide your learning journey with Symfony.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand Symfony's core components: routing, controllers, services, and templates.
- Learn to build modular, reusable, and maintainable web applications with Symfony.
- Master Symfony's powerful features, such as dependency injection, event-driven architecture, and the Symfony CLI.
- Gain experience in API development with Symfony, including integration with the Symfony API Platform.
- Build secure applications using Symfony's built-in security features (authentication, authorization, and user management).
- Learn how to integrate databases using Doctrine ORM and perform migrations.
- Develop full-scale applications with Symfony best practices, focusing on performance and scalability.

## 📂 Folder Structure
This directory is organized to facilitate a hands-on learning experience. Each folder represents a specific topic or concept within Symfony, allowing you to explore and practice as you go.

## 📚 Learning Path

This learning path is designed to take you from Symfony fundamentals to advanced architectural mastery. It follows a hands-on structure using the folders in this repo and covers both core concepts and ecosystem tools.


### 🧭 Stage 1 — Getting Started
- [ ] **Introduction**: Understand what Symfony is, its philosophy, and how it compares to other frameworks.
- [ ] **Installation & Setup**: Install Symfony CLI, Composer, and create your first Symfony project.
- [ ] **Folder: `basics/`**


### 🧱 Stage 2 — Core MVC & Routing
- [ ] **Routing**: Learn how routing works in Symfony using YAML, annotations, or PHP config.
- [ ] **Controllers**: Create controller classes and actions for handling HTTP requests.
- [ ] **Twig Templates**: Use the Twig engine to create dynamic views.
- [ ] **Folder: `routing/`, `controllers/`, `templates/`**


### 🛠️ Stage 3 — Data, Services & Forms
- [ ] **Doctrine Entities**: Map database tables with Doctrine ORM using entity classes.
- [ ] **Repositories**: Create custom repository methods for complex data access logic.
- [ ] **Services & DI**: Learn about services, autowiring, dependency injection, and service configuration.
- [ ] **Forms & Validation**: Build and validate forms with Symfony’s Form component.
- [ ] **Folder: `Entity/`, `Repository/`, `services/`, `forms/`**


### 🔐 Stage 4 — Authentication, Security & Files
- [ ] **Authentication**: Implement user login, registration, and roles with security.yaml.
- [ ] **Authorization**: Manage access using voters, access control, and firewalls.
- [ ] **Static & Media Files**: Serve static assets and handle file uploads.
- [ ] **Folder: `authentication/`, `static_files/`, `media_files/`**


### 🌐 Stage 5 — APIs & Asynchronous Operations
