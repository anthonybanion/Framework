# ðŸš€ Symfony â€” Mastering the PHP Framework

Welcome to the **Symfony/** directory of the **LearnFw** repository.
This section is dedicated to learning and mastering Symfony, one of the most robust and flexible PHP frameworks for building high-performance, scalable web applications.

Whether you're just getting started with PHP frameworks or aiming to build enterprise-level applications, this space provides a structured approach to guide your learning journey with Symfony.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand Symfony's core components: routing, controllers, services, and templates.
- Learn to build modular, reusable, and maintainable web applications with Symfony.
- Master Symfony's powerful features, such as dependency injection, event-driven architecture, and the Symfony CLI.
- Gain experience in API development with Symfony, including integration with the Symfony API Platform.
- Build secure applications using Symfony's built-in security features (authentication, authorization, and user management).
- Learn how to integrate databases using Doctrine ORM and perform migrations.
- Develop full-scale applications with Symfony best practices, focusing on performance and scalability.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
This directory is divided into two main sections: **playground** and **projects**.
