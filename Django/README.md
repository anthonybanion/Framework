# 🐍 Django — Mastering the Python Web Framework

Welcome to the **Django/** directory of the **LearnFw** repository.
This section is dedicated to learning and mastering Django, one of the most powerful and widely used web frameworks for building robust, scalable, and secure applications in Python.

Whether you're just getting started with backend development or aiming to build full-fledged web applications, this space provides a structured approach to guide your learning journey.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand Django's core concepts: models, views, templates, and URL routing.
- Build modular, reusable, and maintainable web applications.
- Learn to integrate databases, handle user authentication, and manage static and media files.
- Master advanced Django features like class-based views, middleware, and Django REST Framework (DRF) for building APIs.
- Develop full-fledged Django applications with an emphasis on best practices and security.

## 📂 Folder Structure
