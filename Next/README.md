## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the architecture and purpose of Next.js in modern frontend development.
- Build pages using file-based routing and dynamic parameters.
- Learn data fetching strategies: `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `getInitialProps`.
- Explore API routes, middleware, and full-stack capabilities.
- Implement authentication, form handling, and state management.
- Optimize for performance, SEO, and Core Web Vitals.
- Deploy using Vercel and other cloud platforms with CI/CD support.

## 📚 Learning Path

This roadmap helps you go from beginner to advanced with NestJS, building real-world backends with confidence.

### 🧭 Stage 1 — Getting Started
- [ ] **What is NestJS**: Understand its purpose and how it's different from plain Express.
- [ ] **Installation**: Install Nest CLI and create your first project (`nest new`).
- [ ] **Project Structure**: Learn how modules, controllers, and services work together.
- [ ] **TypeScript First**: Understand how Nest leverages decorators, interfaces, and DI.
- [ ] **Folder: `getting_started/`**


### 🧱 Stage 2 — Core Architecture
- [ ] **Modules**: Organize your app into feature modules.
- [ ] **Controllers**: Handle routing and HTTP methods.
- [ ] **Services**: Write reusable business logic.
- [ ] **Providers & Injection**: Learn about custom and async providers.
- [ ] **DTO & Validation**: Use `class-validator` and `class-transformer` for validation.
- [ ] **Folder: `modules/`, `controllers/`, `services/`, `dto_validation/`, `providers/`**


### 🔐 Stage 3 — Middleware, Guards, Interceptors
- [ ] **Middleware**: Use request interceptors and logger middleware.
- [ ] **Guards**: Implement role-based access control.
- [ ] **Interceptors**: Modify responses and apply logic before/after handlers.
- [ ] **Exception Filters**: Centralize error handling.
- [ ] **Folder: `middleware/`, `guards/`, `interceptors/`, `filters/`**


### 🗃️ Stage 4 — Databases & Authentication
- [ ] **Database Setup**: Connect with TypeORM, Prisma, or Sequelize.
- [ ] **Repository Pattern**: Handle DB queries using Nest’s built-in or custom repos.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Use Passport.js and JWT strategies.
- [ ] **Authorization**: Protect routes and use guards effectively.
- [ ] **Folder: `database/`, `authentication/`**


### 🧪 Stage 5 — Testing
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Test services and controllers in isolation.
- [ ] **E2E Testing**: Test API behavior end-to-end with Supertest.
- [ ] **Folder: `testing/`**


### 🚀 Stage 6 — Deployment & Real-World Topics
- [ ] **Deployment**: Use Docker, PM2, or deploy to Heroku/Railway/Vercel.
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Use `ConfigModule` and `.env` for secure config.
- [ ] **Performance & Logging**: Add structured logging with Winston or Pino.
- [ ] **Folder: `deployment/`**


### 🧠 Stage 7 — Advanced Features
- [ ] **GraphQL Support**: Use `@nestjs/graphql` with Apollo Server.
- [ ] **WebSockets**: Implement real-time communication.
- [ ] **Microservices**: Build distributed systems with NestJS transport layers (Redis, Kafka).
- [ ] **Cron Jobs & Scheduling**: Use `@nestjs/schedule`.
- [ ] **Folder: `advanced/`**

### 🛠️ Stage 8 — Real-World Projects
- [ ] **basic projects/**: Build simple REST APIs with CRUD operations.
- [ ] **advanced projects/**: Build full-stack applications with authentication, database, and state management.
- [ ] **small projects/**: Build small applications with no backend.
- [ ] **Folder: `projects/`**
